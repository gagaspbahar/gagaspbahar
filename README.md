### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name is Gagas Praharsa Bahar, someone who aspires to be a developer in the future. I am currently studying at Bandung Institute of Technology, majoring in Informatics
I'm currently beginning to learn the basics of programming and getting the hang of Python, C, and C++. IT was always my passion in my life and i aspire to be a professional in this field.
I'm also focusing my studies to be a data scientist or software engineer, whichever i like better on the road, i'll pick it as my main field. I'm still a newcomer to coding, and i'm looking forward to learn a lot!

You can reach me by email: gagaspbahar@gmail.com.

Have a beautiful day!
